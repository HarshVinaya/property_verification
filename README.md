This repository contains EEG and RTs data and code for replication of <link>

Words and Worlds Both: Dynamic Effects of Distributional and Sensorimotor Information in Semantic Processing

Harshada Vinaya, Sean Trott, Diane Pecher, Ren√© Zeelenberg, Seana Coulson. 

The repo contains two folders:

(1) Data

Each of the .csv file contains 100 ms EEG voltage averages for each channel, and trial, for a specific time duration with respect to the onset of the property word (e.g. 0_100 for 100 ms post word onset). 

Data for a total of 9 such measurement windows are present, from 100 ms before to 800 ms after the word onset. 

The folder also contains a file with RTs for each trial. All .csv files have predictor measurements included to run the analysis. 


(2) Code

Total 10 .Rmd files are present. Nine for each of the 100 ms EEG time windows, and one for modelling RTs.
